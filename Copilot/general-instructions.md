# General Instruction

- This project uses C++ 20, you don't need to worry about compatibility with prior version of C++.
- All code should be crossed-platform. In case when OS feature is needed, a Windows version and a Linux version should be prepared in different files, following the `*.Windows.cpp` and `*.Linux.cpp` naming convention, and keep them as small as possible.
- DO NOT MODIFY any source code in the `Import` folder, they are dependencies.
- DO NOT MODIFY any source code in the `Release` folder, they are generated release files.
- You can modify source code in the `Source` and `Test` folder.
- Use tabs for indentation in C++ source code.
- Header files are guarded with macros instead of `#pragma once`.
- Use `auto` to define variables if it is doable. Use `auto&&` when the type is big or when it is a collection type.
- In header files, do not use `using namespace` statement, full name of types are always required. In a class/struct/union declaration, member names must be aligned in the same column at least in the same public, protected or private session. Please follow this coding style just like other part of the code.
- In cpp files, use `using namespace` statement if necessary to prevent from repeating namespace everywhere.
- The project only uses a very minimal subset of the standard library. I have substitutions for most of the STL constructions. Always use mine if possible:
  - Always use `vint` instead of `int`.
  - Always use `L'x'`, `L"x"`, `wchar_t`, `const wchar_t` and `vl::WString`, instead of `std::string` or `std::wstring`.
  - Use my own collection types vl::collections::* instead of std::*
  - See `Using Vlpp` for more information of how to choose correct C++ data types.
