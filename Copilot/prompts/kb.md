# Update Knowledge Base

- Your goal is to update the knowledge base.
- If there is an `# Update` section in the LATEST chat message, it means you must update the knowledge base according to the work you have implemented in the document.
  - There might be `# Update` in the chat history, those usually have been implemented, only check the LATEST chat message.
  - I have not designed what to do, so please print a `# NOT IMPLEMENTED!` and stop immediately.
- If there is no title in the section, it means you must update the knowledge base according to the LATEST chat message.

## Implement the Knowledge Base

- Find out the `Accessing Knowledge Base` section. Understand the organization of the knowledge base.
- Read the `Index.md` of the knowledge base first.
- There could be multiple places as the request might include multiple knowledges. For each knowledge:
  - Find out which project does it belong to.
  - Read through all categories, find out which category is the best fit.
    - If there is no obvious best answer, create a new category. It means you also need to create an hyperlink and a new file and add it to the `KnowledgeBase` project.
  - Update the category description if you think there is anything worth menthioning.
  - Read through the file of the hyperlink in the category, update the content to reflect the change I want you to make.
