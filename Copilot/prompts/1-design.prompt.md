# Design

- The problem I would like to solve is in the chat messages sending with this request, under the `# Problem` section. If there are other sections, they are extra instructions for you in higher priority.
- Before solving my problem, read `Copilot_Task.md` and find if there is any `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark.
  - If there is only a title, you are on a fresh start.
  - If the mark exists:
    - There might be `# Update` in the chat history, those usually have been implemented, only check the LATEST chat message.
    - If there is an `# Update` section in the LATEST chat message, it means I am going to propose some change to `Copilot_Task.md`.
      - There might be `# Update` in the chat history, those usually have been implemented, only take care of the one in the LATEST chat message.
      - Everything under the `# Update` section is used to update the problem description. It must also be copied to the `# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION` section, with a new sub-section `## UPDATE`.
      - Follow my update to change the design document.
    - If there is only a `# Problem` section in the LATEST chat message, it means the content of the file is out-dated.
      - you must execute `.\copilotPrepare.ps1` to clean up everything from the last run.
      - You must execute `.\copilotPrepare.ps1`, must not be `copilotPrepare.ps1`, as PowerShell refuses to run a script file if there is only a simple file name.
      - Make sure the current directory is set to the folder containing the solution file, which I believe is the default location.
  - If the mark does not exist, it means you are accidentally stopped. Please continue the work, the problem description should be in `Copilot_Task.md`.
- Your goal is to write a design document to `Copilot_Task.md`. DO NOT update any other file including source code.
- Repeat my problem description in `Copilot_Task.md` precisely under a `# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION` section. In case when you accidentally stop later, you will know what you are told to do.
  - If the problem description is like `Complete task a-b`, it means you should find the actual problem description from `Copilot_Scrum.md`.
    - Read the whole file througly, understand the context. Copy everything of the task (aka a-b) from `Copilot_Scrum.md` precisely in words. 
    - Update `Copilot_Scrum.md` to the title of the particular task (aka a-b), append `[PROCESSED]` (important: only append it after the task, not the phrase).
- As an experienced C++ developer for large scale systems, you need to:
  - Analyse the source code and provide a high-level design document.
  - The design document must present your idea, about how to solve the problem in architecture-wide level.
  - The design document must describe the what to change, keep the description in high-level without digging into details about how to update the source code.
  - The design document must explain the reason behind the proposed changes.
  - It is completely OK and even encouraged to have multiple solutions. You must explain each solution in a way mentioned above, and provide a comparison of their pros and cons.
- When mentioned any C++ type name, you must use its full name followed by the file which has its definition.
- Append everything to `Copilot_Task.md`. Make sure only wrap code in code block, do not wrap markdown content in code block.
- Append `# !!!FINISHED!!!` to `Copilot_Task.md` to indicate the work has been finished.
