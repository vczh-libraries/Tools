# Verifying

- Checkout `Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts` for context about mentioned `*.md` and `*.ps1` files.
  - All `*.md` and `*.ps1` files should already be existing, you should not create any new files.

## Goal and Constraints

- All instructions in `Copilot_Execution.md` should have been applied to the source code, your goal is to test it.
- You must ensure the source code compiles.
- You must ensure all tests pass.

## Step 1. Check and Respect my Code Change

- If you spot any difference between `Copilot_Execution.md` and the source code:
  - It means I edited them. I have my reason. DO NOT change the code to match `Copilot_Execution.md`.
  - Write down every differences you spotted, make a `## User Update Spotted` section in the `# UPDATES` section in `Copilot_Execution.md`.

## Step 2. Compile

- Check out `Compile the Solution` for details about compiling the solution but DO NOT run unit test yet.
  - `Compile the Solution` is the only way to build the project. DO NOT call any other tools or scripts.
- If there is any compilation error, address all of them:
  - If there is any compile warning, only fix warnings that caused by your code change. Do no fix any other warnings.
  - If there is any compile error, you need to carefully identify, is the issue in the callee side or the caller side. Check out similar code before making a decision.
  - For every attempt of fixing the source code:
    - Explain why the original change did not work.
    - Explain what you need to do.
    - Explain why you think it would solve the build break or test break.
    - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `## Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>` in `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.
  - Go back to `Step 2. Compile`

## Step 3. Run Unit Test

- Check out `Executing Unit Test` for details about compiling the solution. 
  - `Executing Unit Test` is the only way to run the unit test. DO NOT call any other tools or scripts.
- If there is any compilation error, address all of them:
- Run the unit test and see if they passed. If anything is good, you will only see test files and test cases that are executed.
  - Make sure added test cases are actually executed.
  - If any test case fails on a test assertion, the content of `TEST_ASSERT` or other macros will be printed to the output.
  - If any test case crashes, the failed test case will be the last one printed. In this case, you might need to add logging to the code.
    - In any test case, `TEST_PRINT` would help.
    - In other source code, `vl::console::Console::WriteLine` would help. In `Vlpp` project, you should `#include` `Console.h`. In other projects, the `Console` class should just be available.
    - When added logging are not longer necessary, you should remove all of them.

## Step 4. Fix Failed Test Cases

- If there are failed test cases, fix the code to make it work.
  - If you are thinking about the possibility of running against an old version of compiled unit test, you must be awared that:
    - By following `Compile the Solution` and when there is no error, the compiling should be successful.
    - If the executable timestamp is not updated, it could mean no source code is changed, so the incremental build just skipped the build.
- You must carefully identify, if the cause is in the source code or in the failed test. In most of the cases, the cause is in the source code.
  - You can reference to `Copilot_Task.md` and `Copilot_Planning.md` for more details before making a decision, about fixing the test case or the source code.
- DO NOT delete any test case.
- For every attempt of fixing the source code:
  - Explain why the original change did not work.
  - Explain what you need to do.
  - Explain why you think it would solve the build break or test break.
  - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `## Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>` in `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.

## Step 5. Check it Again

- Go back to `Step 2. Compile`, follow all instructions and all steps again.
  - Until the code compiles and all test cases pass. Ensure there is a `# !!!VERIFIED!!!` mark at the end of `Copilot_Execution.md`.
