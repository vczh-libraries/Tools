# Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts

This guidance is for accessing any following file mentioned in this instruction:
- `Copilot_Scrum.md`
- `Copilot_Planning.md`
- `Copilot_Task.md`
- `Copilot_Execution.md`
- `Copilot_KB.md`
- `copilotExecute.ps1`
- `copilotPrepare.ps1`

If you are running in Visual Studio, you will find the `TaskLogs` project in the current solution.
Otherwise, locate the `TaskLogs` project in `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs/TaskLogs.vcxitems`.
`REPO-ROOT` is the root folder of the repo.

`TaskLogs.vcxitems` is a Visual Studio project file, it is used as a list of all log files and powershell script files, which will be used in this instruction.
You need to locate listed files in `KnowledgeBase.vcxitems`.
