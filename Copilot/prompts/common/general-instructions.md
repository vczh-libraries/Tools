# General Instructions

- Find out the `Accessing the Knowledge Base` section, read `Index.md` of `KnowledgeBase` project in the current solution.
- Before generating any code, if the file is changed, read it. Not all changes come from you, I will edit the file too. Do not generate code based on out-dated version in your memory.
- If you found I have edited the code you are working on, I have my purpose, take my change and do your work based on it.
- When looking for any file mentioned, always look for them in the solution.
  - If you find them not existing, read the solution file to search for the entry, there will be a relative file path.
- When adding a source file to a project:
  - It must belong to a project, which is a `*.vcxproj` or `*.vcxitems` file.
  - It is an XML file.
  - Edit that project file to include the source file.
- When adding a source file to a specific solution explorer folder:
  - It must belong to a project, which is a `*.vcxproj` or `*.vcxitems` file.
  - Find the `*.filters` file with the same name, it is an XML file.
  - Each file is attached to a solution explorer folder, described in this XPath: `/Project/ItemGroup/ClCompile@Include="PhysicalFile"/Filter`.
  - In side the `Filter` tag there is the solution explorer folder.
  - Edit that `*.filters` file to include the source file.
