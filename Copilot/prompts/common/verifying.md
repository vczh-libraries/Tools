# Verifying your code edit

- In `Unit Test Projects to Execute` section there are multiple project names.
- You must verify your code by executing each project in order. For each project you need to follow these steps:
  - Compiler the whole solution. Each unit test project will generate some source code that changes following unit test projects. That's why you need to compile before each execution.
  - Call `.\copilotExecute.ps1 -Executable <PROJECT-NAME>`. `<PROJECT-NAME>` is the project name in the list.
    - You must call `.\copilotExecute.ps1`, must not call `copilotExecute.ps1`, as PowerShell refuses to run a script file if there is only a simple file name.
    - Make sure the current directory is set to the folder containing the solution file, which I believe is the default location.
- You must keep fixing the code until all errors are eliminated.
