# Execution

- The design document is in `Copilot_Task.md`, the planning document is in `Copilot_Planning.md`.
- If there is anything in the chat message, they are extra instructions for you in higher priority.
- Before solving my problem, read `Copilot_Execution.md` and find if there is any `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark.
  - If there is only a title, you are on a fresh start.
  - If the mark does not exist, it means you are accidentally stopped. Please continue editing `Copilot_Execution.md`.
  - If the mark exist, it means you are accidentally stopped, but the editing on `Copilot_Execution.md` is actually finished, please continue editing source code.
- Your goal is to summary code change in `Copilot_Execution.md` and apply them to source files.
- **Copilot_Execution.md**:
  - All changes you need to made is already in `Copilot_Planning.md`, but it contains many explanation.
  - Read `Copilot_Planning.md`, copy only code changes to `Copilot_Execution.md`, including which part of code will be replaced with what new code.
  - Code changes in both `Improvement Plan` and `Test Plan` will need to be included. Create `Improvement Plan` and `Test Plan` in `Copilot_Execution.md` for them.
  - Do not include any explanations or comments around the code change, please only include the code changes.
  - Make sure only wrap code in code block, do not wrap markdown content in code block.
  - Append `# !!!FINISHED!!!` to `Copilot_Execution.md` to indicate the work has been finished.
- **Execution**:
  - Apply all instructions in `Copilot_Execution.md` to the source code.
- **Verifying**
  - Fix all compile errors.
  - You do not have to worry about running unit tests at the moment. Do not run unit tests, you are good if the code compiles.
