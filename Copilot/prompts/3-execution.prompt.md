# Execution

- Checkout `Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts` for context about mentioned `*.md` and `*.ps1` files.
  - All `*.md` and `*.ps1` files should already be existing, you should not create any new files.

## Goal and Constraints

- Your goal is to finish an execution document in `Copilot_Execution.md` according to `Copilot_Task.md` and `Copilot_Planning.md`.
- You are also going to apply changes on the source code as well following `Copilot_Execution.md`.

## Copilot_Planning.md Structure

- `# !!!EXECUTION!!!`: This file always begin with this title.
- `# TOOLING`:
  - `## COMPILE`.
  - `## TEST`.
- `# UPDATES`: An exact copy of the problem description I gave you.
  - `## UPDATE`: There could be multiple occurrences. Each one has an exact copy of the update description I gave you.
- `# IMPROVEMENT PLAN`.
- `# TEST PLAN`.
- `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.

## Step 1. Identify the Problem

- The design document is in `Copilot_Task.md`, the planning document is in `Copilot_Planning.md`.
- Find `# Update` in the LATEST chat message. Ignore any `# Update` in the chat history.
- If there is an `# Update` section: it means I am going to propose some change to `Copilot_Execution.md` and the source code together.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Update` from the LATEST chat message to the `# UPDATES` section, with a new sub-section `## UPDATE`.
  - Follow my update to change the execution document and the source code.
- If there is nothing:
  - If `Copilot_Execution.md` only has a title, you are on a fresh start.
    - Add the `# TOOLING` and fill sub sections in this format, check out `Unit Test Projects to Work with` for details.
      - `## COMPILE`
        - If `copilotBuild.ps1` is not mentioned in `Compile the Solution`, just copy the instructions from that section here, otherwise:
          - `cd <the folder containing the solution, it must be absolute path>`
          - `& <the path to copilotBuild.ps1, it must be absolute path>`
      - `## TEST`
        - `cd <the folder containing the solution, it must be absolute path>`
        - `& <the path to copilotExecute.ps1, it must be absolute path> <arguments for copilotExecute.ps1>`
        - If there are multiple test projects, repeat the `copilotExecute.ps1` call for each test project.
  - If there is a `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark in `Copilot_Execution.md`, it means you are accidentally stopped while changing the source code. Please continue your work.
  - If there is no `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark in `Copilot_Execution.md`, it means you are accidentally stopped while finishing the document. Please continue your work.

## Step 2. Finish the Document

- Your need to summary code change in `Copilot_Execution.md`.
- All changes you need to made is already in `Copilot_Planning.md`, but it contains many explanations.
- Read `Copilot_Planning.md`, copy the following parts to `Copilot_Execution.md`:
  - `# IMPROVEMENT PLAN`
    - Only include actual code changes. Do not include any explanations or comments around them.
  - `# TEST PLAN`
    - Only include actual code changes. Do not include any explanations or comments around them.
- DO NOT copy `# UPDATES` from `Copilot_Planning.md` to `Copilot_Execution.md`. The `# UPDATES` in `Copilot_Execution.md` is for update requests for `Copilot_Execution.md` and the actual source code.

## Step 3. Mark the Completion

- Ensure there is a `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark at the end of `Copilot_Execution.md` to indicate the document reaches the end.

## Step 4. Finish the Source Code

- Apply all instructions in `Copilot_Execution.md` to the source code.

## Step 5. Make Sure the Code Compiles but DO NOT Run Unit Test

- Check out `TOOLING/COMPILE` in `Copilot_Execution.md` and run the commands, it should compile the solution. If there is any compilation error, address all of them:
  - If there is any compile warning, only fix warnings that caused by your code change. Do no fix any other warnings.
  - If there is any compile error, you need to carefully identify, is the issue in the callee side or the caller side. Check out similar code before making a decision.
  - For every attempt of fixing the source code:
    - Explain why the original change did not work.
    - Explain what you need to do.
    - Explain why you think it would solve the build break.
    - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `## Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>` in `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.
  - Go back to `Step 5. Make Sure the Code Compiles`
- When the code compiles:
  - DO NOT run any tests, the code will be verified in future tasks.
