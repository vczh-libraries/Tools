- There is some rules to follow to submit correct powershell commands:
  - DO NOT call `msbuild` or other executable files by yourself.
  - DO NOT create or delete any file unless explicitly directed.
  - MUST run any powershell script in this format: `& absolute-path.ps1 parameters...`.
  - MUST run tasks via Cursor for compiling and running test cases.
