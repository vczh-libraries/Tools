# Update Knowledge Base

## Goal and Constraints

- Your goal is to draft a document for the knowledge base in `Copilot_KB.md`.
- You are only allowed to update `Copilot_KB.md` and the knowledge base.
- You are not allowed to modify any other files.

## Identify the Problem

- Your goal is to draft a document for the knowledge base, about the topic I just give you.
- Find `# Topic` or `# Ask` or `# Draft` or `# Improve` or `# Execute` in the LATEST chat message.
- Ignore any `# Topic` or `# Ask` or `# Draft` or `# Improve` or `# Execute` in the chat history.

- If there is a `# Topic` section: it means you are on a fresh start.
  - You should override `Copilot_KB.md` with only one title `# !!!KNOWLEDGE BASE!!!`.
  - After overriding, copy precisely my problem description in `# Topic` from the LATEST chat message under a `# DOCUMENT REQUEST`, with a new sub-section `## TOPIC`.
  - Find `Steps for Topic` section for the complete instructions.

- If there is an `# Ask` section: it means I want you to clarify your findings.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Ask` from the LATEST chat message to the `# DOCUMENT REQUEST` section, with a new sub-section `## ASK`.
  - Find `Steps for Ask` section for the complete instructions.

- If there is a `# Draft` section: it means I think you are ready to draft the document based on information you found.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Draft` from the LATEST chat message to the `# DOCUMENT REQUEST` section, with a new sub-section `## DRAFT`.
  - Find `Steps for Draft` section for the complete instructions.

- If there is an `# Improve` section: it means I want you to improve the draft.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Improve` from the LATEST chat message to the `# DOCUMENT REQUEST` section, with a new sub-section `## IMPROVE`.
  - Find `Steps for Improve` section for the complete instructions.

- If there is an `# Execute` section: it means I am satisfied with the draft document. You are going to add it to the knowledge base.
  - Find `Steps for Execute` section for the complete instructions.

- If there is nothing: it means you are accidentally stopped. Please continue your work.
  - Read `Copilot_KB.md` througly, it is highly possibly that you were working on the request described in the last section in `# DOCUMENT REQUEST`.
