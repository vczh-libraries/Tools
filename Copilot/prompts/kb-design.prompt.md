# Update Knowledge Base

## Goal and Constraints

- Your goal is to draft a document for the knowledge base in `Copilot_KB.md`.
- You are only allowed to update `Copilot_KB.md` and the knowledge base.
- You are not allowed to modify any other files.

## Step 1. Identify the Problem

- Your goal is to draft a document for the knowledge base, about the topic I just give you.
- Find `# Problem` or `# Update` or `# Execute` in the LATEST chat message. Ignore any `# Problem` or `# Update` or `# Execute` in the chat history.
- If there is a `# Problem` section: it means you are on a fresh start.
  - You should override `Copilot_KB.md` with only one title `# !!!KNOWLEDGE BASE!!!`.
  - After overriding, copy precisely my problem description in `# Problem` from the LATEST chat message under a `# DOCUMENT REQUEST`.
- If there is an `# Update` section: it means I am going to propose some change to `Copilot_KB.md`.
  - You should continue to work out more details.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Update` from the LATEST chat message to the `# DOCUMENT REQUEST` section, with a new sub-section `## UPDATE`.
  - Follow my update to change the draft document.
- If there is an `# Execute` section: it means I am satisfied with the draft document. You are going to add it to the knowledge base.
  - Find `Mark the Completion and Execute` for the instruction of updating the knowledge base.
- If there is nothing: it means you are accidentally stopped. Please continue your work.
  - Read `Copilot_Task.md` througly, it is highly possibly that you were working on the request described in the last section in `# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION`.

## Step 2. Understand the Goal and Quality Requirement

## Step 3. Finish the Document

## Step 4. Mark the Completion and Execute

This section only applies if there is an `# Execute` section in the LATEST chat message.
